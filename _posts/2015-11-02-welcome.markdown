#Hi =)

Welcome to my blog. I’m Pedro Vieira and I’m currently working at [Mindera](http://www.mindera.com) as Frontend Engineer.

For the past two years I’ve been learning a lot from great software bloggers. I’m deeply grateful to be part of this profession where gurus enjoy sharing their knowledge. Other than the sharing of knowledge, having a blog is also important for our continuous improvement. So, those are the main reasons behind the creation of this blog.

###Areas of interest:
Web Components, Components-Based Architecture, Clean code, Software Craftsmanship, TDD;

###References:
Software: Uncle Bob, Martin Fowler, Kent Beck, Addy Osmani, Nicholas Zakas, David Walsh;
General: Olof Palme, Tolstói, Henry David Thoreau, Gandhi, Boaventura Sousa Santos.

###Hobbies:
Politics, economics, philosophy, science, sports, movies, music.
